### Parts needed

* ESP32 controller
* DHT22 or similar DHT temperature/humidity sensor
* Relays board to control lights/pump
* MOSFET board to control LED brightness, fan speed etc. via PWM

The device creates an access point on first start. Then you can configure your WiFi and pin settings.

### Caution

The WiFi password is saved without encryption on the device. 
Also OTA-update has default password "admin" at the moment.
Change it if you want to secure your device for unauthorized updates.

**Make the webinterface accessible from internet is a very bad idea!**

### ToDo:

* make more dynamic config site
* webinterface with authorization
